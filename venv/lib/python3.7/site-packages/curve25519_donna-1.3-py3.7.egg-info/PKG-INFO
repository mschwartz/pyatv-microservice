Description: Curve25519 is a fast elliptic-curve key-agreement protocol, in which two
        parties Alice and Bob each generate a (public,private) keypair, exchange
        public keys, and can then compute the same shared key. Specifically, Alice
        computes F(Aprivate, Bpublic), Bob computes F(Bprivate, Apublic), and both
        get the same value (and nobody else can guess that shared value, even if they
        know Apublic and Bpublic).
        
        This is a Python wrapper for the portable 'curve25519-donna' implementation
        of this algorithm, written by Adam Langley, hosted at
